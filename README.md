# GSoC 2021!

A place to track Google Summer of Code Ideas.

See the [Ideas category in Discussions](https://github.com/elementary/GSoC/discussions/categories/ideas).

Good ideas posts should contain:
* A descriptive title
* A detailed description of the problem, including possible motives and use cases
* Expected outcomes of the students' work on the project
* Skills required
* links to relevant information and resources
* If possible, an indication of project difficulty

Keep in mind that these are projects for students that should be completed over a 10 week period. Projects should be reasonable and focused on learning.

See this page for more info: https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list

**Please comment on ideas that you would be willing to help mentor!** Students will need dedicated and attentive mentorship to complete their projects
